                                <div class="left">1) the distribution of card tiles is the least beneficial for a
                                    player, in particular,
                                    for every new pair of cards clicked (except for the first two and the last two):
                                    <br> - first card of a pair is always new (hasn't been in previous pairs);
                                    <br> - second card of a pair has already been in previous pairs;<br>
                                    that means: an additonal (second) click is always required for every card (except
                                    for the last two cards) to match them all;
                                    <br>2) a player makes no mistakes:
                                    <br> - never clicks on one and the same card more than two times (except for the
                                    last two revealed cards);
                                    <br> - always clicks only once on each of the last two revealed cards.
